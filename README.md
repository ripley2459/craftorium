# Craftorium

Craftorium is an unoriginal tech mod that features hundreds of items, blocks, and fluids based on real and fantasy materials. Along with this semi-complex material system, there are machines that can function to transform objects into other objects.

This mod is primarily created for the New Elysium modpack but it works perfectly in any other scenario, notably thanks to CraftTweaker.

## Features

* Sets of items, blocks and fluids based on real and fantasy substances.
* Machines can accept items, blocks, and/or fluids and process their inputs into other items, blocks, and/or fluids. Machines consume RF, their faces are programmable and can perform their tasks more or less quickly depending on the level of the machine.
